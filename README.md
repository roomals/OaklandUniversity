# 🔎 Academic Transparency Initiative: Exposing Outdated Educational Materials  

## 📜 Overview  
This project is dedicated to exposing the fraudulent use of outdated academic materials being repackaged and sold as "new" to students. Using **ExifTool**, this script extracts metadata from course files, revealing creation dates, modification timestamps, and authorship discrepancies.  

### ⚠️ **Why This Matters**  
- Students are paying for "updated" content that is decades old.  
- Professors are recycling the same documents while charging for new editions.  
- This system exploits students and diminishes the integrity of higher education.  

## 🛠 How It Works  
This script:  
1. Recursively scans all files in the **Syllabi** and **Warehouse** directories.  
2. Extracts metadata using `exiftool`.  
3. Filters out irrelevant file types (`.md`, `.csv`, `.jpg`, `.png`).  
4. Saves the metadata into a structured `.csv` file.  

## 🚀 Installation  
### **Prerequisites**  
Ensure you have `exiftool` installed. On Linux, run:  
```bash
sudo apt install libimage-exiftool-perl
```


## 🔥 **What This Means for Higher Education**  
- **Students deserve transparency** in what they are paying for.  
- **Outdated knowledge is unacceptable** in an institution that claims to educate.  
- **Public exposure forces accountability.**  

## 📢 **Next Steps**  
- Sharing this data with **students, whistleblowers, and investigative journalists**.  
- Holding **universities and faculty accountable** for intellectual dishonesty.  
- Establishing a **public repository** of verified academic materials for free student access.
